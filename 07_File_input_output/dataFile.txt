File I/O (Input/Output) in Python is a mechanism that allows you to interact with files.
(reading, writing and performing various other operations)                                                     
Python provides built-in functions and methods to handle file I/O efficiently.

File Modes
'r' : Read mode. This is the default mode. Opens a file for reading.
'w' : Write mode. Opens a file for writing. If the file exists, it truncates it to zero length. If it doesn't exist, it creates a new file.
'a' : Append mode. Opens a file for writing but does not truncate it. Writes are appended to the end of the file.
'x' : Exclusive creation mode. Opens for writing only if the file does not exist.
'b' : Binary mode. Use this for reading or writing binary files (e.g., images, PDFs).
't' : Text mode. This is the default mode. Use this for reading or writing text files.
'+' : Updating mode. Open a file for both reading and writing.




Opening files: Use open() with the appropriate mode ('r', 'w', 'a', etc.).
Reading files: Use read(), readline(), or readlines() methods.
Writing files: Use write() or writelines() methods.
Closing files: Always close files after use, preferably with a with statement.
