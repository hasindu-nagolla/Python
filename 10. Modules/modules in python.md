In Python, a **module** is a file containing Python code (functions, variables, classes) that you can import into your scripts to reuse code and organize your program into manageable parts.

There are two types of modules in Python:

### 1. **Built-in Modules**:
These are part of the Python standard library, which means you can use them without installing anything.

- `math`: Mathematical functions (e.g., trigonometric functions, factorial, etc.)
- `os`: Interacts with the operating system (e.g., file operations, environment variables)
- `sys`: Provides access to system-specific parameters and functions
- `random`: Implements pseudo-random number generators
- `datetime`: Deals with date and time manipulation
- `json`: Parses JSON strings and converts to Python objects
- `re`: For working with regular expressions
- `collections`: Offers specialized data structures (like deque, namedtuple)
- `itertools`: Provides efficient looping constructs

### 2. **Third-party Modules**:
These are external libraries not included in Python by default but can be installed via `pip`. Some popular third-party modules include:

- `numpy`: Used for numerical computations
- `pandas`: Data manipulation and analysis
- `matplotlib`: For data visualization
- `requests`: Simplifies making HTTP requests
- `tensorflow`: For machine learning and deep learning
- `scikit-learn`: For machine learning algorithms
- `flask`: Web framework for building web applications

You can install third-party modules using `pip` (Python's package manager):
```bash
pip install <module_name>
```
