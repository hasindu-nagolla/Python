# Exercises

## Implement using for loop

# find the total and average of numbers in a list

list = [-1, -12, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

total = 0

for i in list:
    total += i
    
print("Total is: ", total)

avarage = total / len(list)
print("Avarage is: ", avarage)

# Find the max value in a list

max = list[0] # we can use max = 0, because if all values are negative, it will not work
for i in list:
    if i > max:
        max = i
        
print("Max is: ", max)

# Find the min value in a list

min = list[0] 

for i in list:
    if min > i:
        min = i

print("Min is: ", min)

## Implement using a while loop

# find the total and average of numbers in a list

list2 = [2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]

count = 0
total2 = 0

while count < len(list2):
    item = list2[count]
    total2 += item
    
print("Total is: ", total2)
