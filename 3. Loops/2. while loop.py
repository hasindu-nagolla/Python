# While Loop in Python is used to execute a block of statements repeatedly until a given condition is satisfied. And when the condition becomes false, the line immediately after the loop in the program is executed.

x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] # List

count = 0

while count <= 10: # Loop will stop when count is greater than 10
    print("Count is: ", count)
    count += 1
