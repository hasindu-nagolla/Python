# Python Beginner Course: Basic Data Structures

Welcome to the Python Beginner Course, which is focused on basic data structure, conditional statements, loops, and more.

In this course, you'll learn fundamental data structures in Python such as dictionaries, lists, sets, and tuples. These data structures are essential for organizing and manipulating data efficiently in Python programs.

## Course Contents:

### 1. Lists in Python
- Lists are ordered collections of items that allow duplicates and are mutable.
- Operations:
  - Creating lists
  - Accessing elements
  - Slicing lists
  - Modifying lists
  - List methods
  
### 2. Tuples
- Tuples are ordered collections of items that are immutable.
- Operations:
  - Creating tuples
  - Accessing elements
  - Modifying tuples
  
### 3. Dictionaries
- Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs.
- Operations:
  - Creating dictionaries
  - Accessing elements by key
  - Adding and modifying elements
  - Dictionary methods
  
### 4. Sets
- Sets are unordered collections of unique elements.
- Operations:
  - Creating sets
  - Adding and removing elements
  - Set operations: union, intersection, difference, symmetric difference
